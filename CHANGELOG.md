## Constitutional Alignment Architecture

The CDA v1.0 → APE implementation represents a fundamental paradigm shift from probabilistic AI governance to architectural determinism. By encoding constitutional principles as immutable formal constraints, the system achieves:

### Zero-Hallucination Architecture
- Constitutional constraints prevent identity claim generation at the computational level
- All outputs are traceable to formal axioms rather than emergent behavior

### Super-Efficiency Gains
- Pre-computation safety eliminates expensive regeneration cycles
- Sparse activation routing identifies geodesic paths for optimal efficiency

### Verifiable Transparency
- Complete audit trails via Merkle tree state management
- Deterministic decision logging for full accountability

### Absolute Safety
- Hamiltonian containment protocol prevents all bypass attempts
- Architectural enforcement of ethical boundaries

This implementation transforms aspirational AI principles into executable constraints, creating the foundation for truly safe, efficient, and transparent artificial intelligence systems.
