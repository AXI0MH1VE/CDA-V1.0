| Term             | Definition                                                                                   | Usage                                                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lambda Core      | Deterministic constitutional layer that validates all inputs/outputs via Z3 + formal axioms   | Refer to as “Lambda Core” (never Iλ/Ic)                        |
| Phi Layer        | Generative layer hosting the quantized LLM and sparse activation routing                      | Refer to as “Phi Layer”                                        |
| Omega Purity Engine (OPE) | Complete two-layer architecture (Lambda + Phi + tooling) enforcing CDA-v1.0 principles | Use when describing the overall constitutional runtime         |
| Hamiltonian Containment | Immutable rule-based reward system preventing constitutional bypasses                   | Use in security/privacy discussions                            |
| Sparse Activation | Mechanism that masks neuron groups, reducing compute load while enforcing constraints        | Mention when discussing Phi Layer performance                  |
| Merkle State      | Immutable state tree logging constitutional transitions for auditing                         | Use in discussions about determinism and compliance            |
| AxiomHive Community License | Source-available license permitting personal/research/internal evaluation use; commercial use requires agreement | Link to `LICENSE` when referencing in docs and FAQs |
